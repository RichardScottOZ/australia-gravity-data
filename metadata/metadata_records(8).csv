This dataset contains a total of 284 point data values. The data is located in QLD and were acquired in 1980. The point located data were collected in traverse layout at an average station spacing of 500 metres. Terrain corrections were calculated using the INTREPID Geophysics software package. The processed data are checked by GA geophysicists using standard methods for assessing quality to ensure that the final data are fit-for-purpose. All data are provided in EPSG:4283 coordinates, Australian Height Datum (AHD) and gravity datum of AAGD07. The units are degrees, meters, and micrometres per second squared, respectively.
