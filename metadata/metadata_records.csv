This dataset contains a total of 1649 point data values. The data is located in NT and were acquired in 2004. The point located data were collected in grid layout at a station spacing between 50 and 200 metres. Terrain corrections were calculated using the INTREPID Geophysics software package. The processed data are checked by GA geophysicists using standard methods for assessing quality to ensure that the final data are fit-for-purpose. All data are provided in EPSG:4283 coordinates, Australian Height Datum (AHD) and gravity datum of AAGD07. The units are degrees, meters, and micrometres per second squared, respectively.
