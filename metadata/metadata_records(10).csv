This dataset contains a total of 596 point data values. The data is located in WA and were acquired in 1986. The point located data were collected in grid layout at a station spacing between 25 and 300 metres. Terrain corrections were calculated using the INTREPID Geophysics software package. The processed data are checked by GA geophysicists using standard methods for assessing quality to ensure that the final data are fit-for-purpose. All data are provided in EPSG:4283 coordinates, Australian Height Datum (AHD) and gravity datum of AAGD07. The units are degrees, meters, and micrometres per second squared, respectively.
