This dataset contains a total of 2 point data values. The data is located in ACT and were acquired in 1976. The point located data were collected in irregular layout at an average station spacing of 3100 metres. Terrain corrections were calculated using the INTREPID Geophysics software package. The processed data are checked by GA geophysicists using standard methods for assessing quality to ensure that the final data are fit-for-purpose. All data are provided in EPSG:4283 coordinates, Australian Height Datum (AHD) and gravity datum of AAGD07. The units are degrees, meters, and micrometres per second squared, respectively.

The data collected are processed via standard methods to ensure the response recorded is that due only to the rocks in the ground. The results produce datasets that can be interpreted to reveal the geological structure of the sub-surface. The processed data is checked for quality by GA geophysicists to ensure that the final data released by GA are fit-for-purpose. This Georgina Basin Gravity Seismic (P197712) contains a total of 137 point data values acquired at a spacing of 500 metres.
